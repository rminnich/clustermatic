This is a revival of the LANL CM5 code, for the simple reason that we still
can't find anything that works better. We're going to remove all bproc 
dependencies because that kernel support will probably never happen, and 
ps to 4400 nodes doesn't scale anyway. Process execution will still 
copy the binary out, but will do a standard fork/exec. No migration, in other
words.
